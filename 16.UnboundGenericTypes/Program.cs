// It's possible for an unbound generic type to exist at runtime—purely as a Type object.

// The only way to specify an unbound generic type in C# is with the typeof operator:
Type a1 = typeof(A<>);   // Unbound type (notice no type arguments).
Type a2 = typeof(A<,>);  // Use commas to indicate multiple type args.

// You can also use the typeof operator to specify a closed type:
Type a3 = typeof(A<int, int>);

class A<T> { }
class A<T1, T2> { }


// or an open type (which is closed at runtime):
class B<T>
{
    void X() { Type t = typeof(T); }
}
