// For historical reasons, array types are covariant.
Bear[] bears = new Bear[3];
Animal[] animals = bears;     // OK

// The downside of this reusability is that element assignments can fail at runtime:
animals[0] = new Camel();     // Runtime error

class Animal { }
class Bear : Animal { }
class Camel : Animal { }
